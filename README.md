## Disney-Photopass-Downloader
A greasemonkey script that alter's the Photopass page, allowing you to open each photo in a separate tab/window. From there, you can save each one individually in medium resolution (max 1280 pixels on one edge)

## Known Issues
Firefox prevents this script from opening more than 20 tabs, even if popups are explicitely allowed for the photopass site. This means that only the first 20 images will open up.
